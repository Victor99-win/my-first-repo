# my-first-repo
This is my first repository, the first of many repositories by Yah's grace
I am trying to make some changes on my readme-edits but let me use the opportunity to say that i am front-end web developer in the making, waiting to unleash my talent in the tech world very soon.
Came here to check if i can still use GitHub
